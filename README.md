# Hello-World
A Place to put all my beginner Projects and to build off of them 11/29/21
My Name is Logan I am a starting Computer Science Major, I have been self teaching myself for about 6 months now and I am so extremely ready to learn more, I have been struggling with motivation but I know in my heart that I can be good at Coding and Programming, Using Github will be one of the first steps in furthering my career.
