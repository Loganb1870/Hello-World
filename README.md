# Hello-World
This is a beginner project to show off some very basic skills I have. There will be more things added to this File as I go on through my carrer.
My Name is Logan I am a starting Computer Science Major, I have been self teaching myself for about 6 months now and I am so extremely ready to learn more, I have been struggling with motivation but I know in my heart that I can be good at Coding and Programming, Using Github will be one of the first steps in furthering my career.
